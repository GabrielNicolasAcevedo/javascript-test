    <h1>Array Methods</h1>
    <p>Array methods exercises from <a href="https://javascript.info/array-methods#tasks">javascript.info</a></p>
    <p>To be done:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Map to names</li>
        <li>Map to objects</li>
        <li>Sort users by age</li>
        <li>Get average age</li>
        <li>Create keyed object from array</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <h2>1. Map to names</h2>
        <p>You have an array of user objects, each one has user.name. <br>
            Write the code that converts it into an array of names.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>2. Map to objects</h2>
        <p>You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.<br>
            Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated
            from name and surname.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>3. Sort Users by Age</h2>
        <p>Write the function sortByAge(users) that gets an array of objects with the age property and sorts them by
            age.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>4. Get Average Age</h2>
        <p>Write the function getAverageAge(users) that gets an array of objects with property age and returns the
            average age.<br>
            The formula for the average is (age1 + age2 + ... + ageN) / N.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Create keyed object from array</h2>
    <p>Let's say we received an array of users in the form {id:..., name:..., age:... }.<br>
        Create a function groupById(arr) that creates an object from it, with id as the key, and array items as values.</p>
    </div>
